# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This application serves the purpose of providing a working study guide for the prework lessons for the software engineer bootcamp at University of Texas at Austin. 

Using the information provided in the lessons I was able to successfully create a functional webpage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and proper Git flow.

This application is a working collective of the tools and technologies learned during the course of this six month program and will be used to track the progress made.
